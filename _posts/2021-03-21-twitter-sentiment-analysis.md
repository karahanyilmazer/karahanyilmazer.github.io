During my bachelor's studies, I enrolled in the course "Python for Engineering Data Analysis â€“ From Machine Learning to Visualization". I was fortunate to have an amazing team partner, Brigitta Jesica Kartono, and this post is dedicated to our final project.

Together, we did a sentiment analysis of Twitter users based on a hashtag that we chose. Our project consisted of fetching the data using the Twitter API, preprocessing and clustering the tweets using simple natural language processing techniques, clustering the users by modularity and visualizing our results on a network graph.

For those who wish to deep dive into our methodologies, results, and insights, here's our [final report](/assets/pdf/sentiment_analysis_using_python_report-Karahan_Yilmazer.pdf):
