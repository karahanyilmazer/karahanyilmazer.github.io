A very interesting elective course I took delved into simulating the activation of cochlear neurons. This project really captured my interest because it was a direct collision of my two worlds: neuroengineering and design.

In this endeavor, I had the chance to work with incredibly accurate spatial information of cochlear neurons. We represented each neuron with compartments from the Hodgkin-Huxley model, and had access to simulated firing data of these compartments. The main goal? To simulate the propagation of the action potentials. Since I was getting acquainted with Blender at that time and it offered good Python integration, I decided to use it as my primary platform for this project.

Honestly, the best way to understand and appreciate the results is to watch the video of the simulated neurons in action.

While the simulation isn’t perfect, this project stands out as one of the most fulfilling applications of my neuroscientific and engineering knowledge. It's projects like these that truly embody the spirit of this website: a blend of neuroengineering and design.
