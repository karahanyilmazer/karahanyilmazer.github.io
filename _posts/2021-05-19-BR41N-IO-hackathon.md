While preparing for an upcoming internship, I enrolled in the "Human-centered Neuroengineering: Cybathlon" course offered by Nicolas Berberich. A notable aspect of this course was participating in the BR41N.IO Hackathon, a segment of the BCI & Neurotechnology Spring School 2021.

Our project revolved around developing a multiplayer game where two players use EEG headsets to compete against each other. Our team, including Vladislav Samoilov, Vadim Juris, Artem Gazizov, Nevena Niagolova and Harshwardhan Saini, worked well together, and we were pleased to secure 3rd place among the programming projects.

This was my first hackathon experience, and I realized what an accelerated learning opportunity it was for me. I learned about recording and processing EEG signals, both offline and in real-time, and even more importantly, how to work collaboratively with others on a programming project.

After the hackathon, we further improved our system and summarized our findings in our [final report](/assets/pdf/bci_multiplay_report-Karahan_Yilmazer.pdf):
