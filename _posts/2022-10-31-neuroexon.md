Having gained experience in separate projects with motor imagery and Steady State Visually Evoked Potential (SSVEP) based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs), the idea to merge these two paradigms for controlling an assistive arm exoskeleton blossomed during the NeuroTechX Hackathon. Teaming up with the fantastic David S. Martinez, Inés Martín Muñoz and Ritika Gupta, we managed to turn this concept into a working prototype within just one hackathon day.

Reflecting on this project, it's clear that the synergy of each team member’s expertise was the secret ingredient to our success. While I would love to share a lengthy post detailing every aspect of our journey, sometimes a video speaks louder than words. So, I'm excited to share a brief explanation and demo of what we achieved. Enjoy the watch!

P.S.: One of the unexpected delights of this project was our project logo by David, which I think looks pretty fitting.
